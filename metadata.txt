about=Named Nearest Neighbor Method for Linear Features (NNMLF), as the convenient name, this plugin uses a method based on modifying the Nearest Neighbor Method for points. In this method, the Hausdorff Distance is used to obtain a measure of the distance between the lines and, thus, infer about the spatial distribution pattern.
